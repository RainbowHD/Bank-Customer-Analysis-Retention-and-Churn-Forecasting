#### **Project Description**  
This project investigates the factors influencing customer churn in the banking sector and develops predictive models using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **machine learning** techniques. In the machine learning modeling phase, I applied various techniques to handle imbalanced data, including **SMOTE**, **oversampling**, and **undersampling**. The models achieve **84% accuracy**, making them effective for predicting churn.

#### **Project Goals**  
- Investigate the factors influencing bank customer churn.
- Visualize key customer data features using **boxplots** and **countplots** to gain insights into customer behavior.
- Understand various aspects of the customer base and identify the factors affecting customer retention.
- Develop predictive models and retention strategies based on analysis results.
- Leverage insights to make **data-driven decisions** for improving customer retention.
